# covid-19-icts
Analysing coronavirus situation in India in comparison to various other countries.

The code in this repository explores the patterns in COVID-19 data of all countries during Jan-July 2021. We tried to fit in different models of infectious disease spreading(SIR, SIER etc.) to the data in order to predict the peak cases and spreading rates, especially for India. Some of the results here are included in the [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920309863), where we studied the effect of various intervention strategies like lockdown, social distancing and testing, for controlling the spread.
